# mysql-bankruptcy-assignment
In this learning assignment I used MySQL to write a query to solve the task.
The task was to calculate how many years longer a company can operate with profit, assuming a trend of a 20% decrease each year will continue and be constant. The output was asked to be ordered in years from smallest to largest, and show each years profit including the year the profit gets to a negative number. 
Assuming the year is 2024 and the total operating income $1.000.000.
